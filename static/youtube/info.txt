HTML EMBED INFO:
You can embed this with some embed code similar to the one used by YouTube or you can use SWFObject (like I did)
Through the HTML embed code you can send variables to Flash.

SUPPORTED VARIABLES:
* youtube_id = the youtube video ID
* title = custom title for the embedded video
* controls_always_on = true - if you don't want the controls to move outside
* controls_fade_out_time = how many seconds to wait until the controls move out of the video screen
* volume_cookie_on = true - if you want your sound volume value to be saved in a cookie and remember if for another session  


INFO ABOUT THE FLASH FILE:
You can open the FLA file with Flash CS3 (CS3+)
The ActionScript 3.0 code is commented in some parts but it's not that easy to understand if you don't have that much experience.
If you have any problems with the code or the design customization, just send me an email through my ActiveDen profile.


Enjoy!
